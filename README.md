# 🔑 Project Overview
The website focuses primarily on user authentication and serves as the entry page for a social media application. The site demonstrates how to create a sign-in page that is secure and responsive while also being easy for users to understand and navigate.

## 🎨 Frontend Features
**Form Handling**: There are input fields for an email/username and password. Each field has built-in validation logic that is separate from the others.
**Responsive Layout**: The site is easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile screens.
**UI Elements**: There are buttons, icons, and input fields. A framework such as React (with Tailwind or HeroUI) is likely being used.
**State Management**: There are user input and error message components, as well as components for conditional rendering (ex. Remember Me? or Forgot My Password?).
**Integration Ready**: The site has the potential to interface with backend APIs for sending login requests and for the storage of tokens via localStorage or sessionStorage.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
- The React lifecycle methods (form state management, API calling, …) are used for this project.
- Styling and animation with Tailwind CSS.
- The session persistence is accomplished through a check of localStorage.
- There is a clear separation of concerns, which means that the UI components and authentication logic are distinct.
